Version Control
================

Github was used as a VCS for this project. The repository can be found at https://github.com/setap5d/coursework

The repository contains a branch for each developer that they are able to work on. The master branch is used to merge the work of each developer. 

This system allows the developers to work on their own branch without affecting the work of other developers. Once the work is complete, the developer can merge their branch with the master branch. This allows the other developers to review the code and ensure that it is of a high standard before it is merged with the master branch.

If a poorly written piece of code is merged with the master branch, it can be difficult to find and fix the issue. This system allows the developers to work on their own branch and ensure that the code is of a high standard before it is merged with the master branch.
