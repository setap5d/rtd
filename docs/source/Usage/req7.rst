Once the user enters their preferred settings, this will be correctly saved in the database.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the user logs in on a separate device their preferred settings will be correctly applied.

Consequence or side-effect:
---------------------------

- Storing complex settings on the servers may be costly.

- Users may want to have separate settings on different devices.
