Initially, the project page will have no projects, the user can click the "+" button to create a new project. 
This will open a modal where the user can enter the project title, deadline, and team leader.

Consequences or side-effects: 
-----------------------------

- If a user has too many projects, it could cause the application to slow down on the projects page due to the number of widgets being displayed to them.

- Storing more projects on our servers would cost more money as we store more data.
