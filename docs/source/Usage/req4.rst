Tickets can be viewed and worked on by anyone who has access to view the task.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the ticket is resolved, it should notify the assignees of the task.

- Tickets notify the user whenever they are updated, this means that it could result in assignees being spammed with notifications.
