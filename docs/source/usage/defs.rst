A. Project

A project is an organised effort with a specific objective or set of objectives to be achieved. 
It is initiated and undertaken by one or more individuals and can be broken down into 
smaller, manageable tasks.

B. Task
-------

A task is a specific and measurable unit of work within a project. It represents an individual 
objective contributing to the overall project goals. Tasks can be assigned to zero or more 
team members.

C. Team Member
---------------

A team member is an individual actively participating in the collaborative effort of a project. 
Each team member contributes their skills and expertise toward the completion of tasks.

D. Tickets
----------

A ticket is a comment that can be written on any task and viewed by other team members including 
those who are not assigned to a task. The purpose of a ticket is to get help from someone who is not 
assigned to a task. 
It should provide information to the reader about what the problem is, and any other details that 
the writer deems necessary (steps to solve, attempts to fix, etc.)
Once the problem a ticket describes has been fixed, it should be able to be marked as resolved.
