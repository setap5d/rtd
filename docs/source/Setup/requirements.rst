Requirements
===========

- You need to have a Flutter SDK version above 3.2.6 and Dart 3.3.0 installed as it's a prerequisite for Flutter.
- The only Firebase components that need to be installed are Firebase Core (firebase_core) and Firebase Authentication (firebase_auth).
- Flutter Chart (fl_chart 0.66.2) is necessary in order to be able to visualise the "contribution score" feature of our app.
